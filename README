Programming contest practice

Abbreviations of contest names I use

	gcj           Google Code Jam
	cc            Codechef
	tc            Top Coder
	usaco         USACO
	hr            HackerRank
	fbhc          Facebook Hacker Cup
	pe            Project Euler

I use various languages depending on whim, and what languages each contest
allows.

Also some things I wanted to work through, that aren't strictly contest
related.

	rwh           Real World Haskell
	rq            Ruby Quiz
